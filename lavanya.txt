test strategy : steps(ITDS)
1)assess teatability :

operability : 4
controlabilitu : 5
observability : 5
simplycity : 3
undestandability : 5
suitability : 5
stability : 5


2)test factors :  

*authorizatio :- integration testing
*correctness :- integrating testing
*access control :- system testing
*reliabilty :- UAT
*performance :- system testing
*intigrity :- system testing
*continutiy of processing :- post UAT

3)assess drivers that would influence testing/approach :-
*authorization :- integration testing/tester(quality analyst)/validation/blackbox
*correctness :-  integration testing/tester/verification/blackbox/dynamic
*access control :- system testing /tester/verification/blackbox
*reliability :- to what extent we trust/UAT(client/customer)
*performance :- system/tester
*intigrity :- system testing/tester
*continuity of processing :- postUAT/client


4)test plan :

*test item :- application name
*software risk issue :- security,performance
*features to be tested(user stories) :- register users,manager and member function,admin functions
*features not to be tested :- new version(which is not a scope)
*approach :- whitebox,blackbox(it contains code and UI)
*test deliverables :- source code,test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report
*item pass/fail criteria :- if i find 5 minor bugs,1 major bug,with no critical/show stopper in this case(pass)
*suspension & resumption criteria :- show stoper in application/non-availabilyty of resource/when this is resolved
*resposibility :- project manager,test lead,tester,customer
*staffing and testing needs :- testing needs
*schedule :- 2weeks
